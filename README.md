# Data-Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Array data structure
The array data structure has the advantage of accessing any of its elements in constant time. But adding an element at the beginning or somewhere in an array is a costly operation as we have to shift other elements. It's useful when the size of the data is fixed. We have other data structures, each offering unique advantages. We can choose which one to use in our program according to our requirements once we are familiar with different of them. Some algorithms also use a particular data structure in their implementation. Some other data structures are strings, linked lists, stack, queues, trees. Each of these has further types.

Operations on data
For a given data, we may wish to traverse it, search it, insert or delete data. I will perform these operations on different data structures by implementing c/python programs.
